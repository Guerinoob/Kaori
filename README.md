# Kaori

Kaori is a light PHP framework. It eases many aspects of web application development by including :

-- Easy to use routing system based on controllers
-- Database ORM system based on entities
-- A Session wrapper that also provides a quick authentification and logout system
-- A Form Builder that allows to build and render forms with easy customization
-- HTTP classes that wrap requests and response, allowing easy calls to API

But also a WebSocket server, a Mail wrapper, a Cron tasks system and even more !

## Installation

To install Kaori, simply download it, unzip it and go on the install route. It will generate a file called "custom_defines.php" in the root folder.
Then fill in the different constants (database connection info, site name, smtp info...). The ROOT_URL constant is filled when you trigger the installation, but you can change it at anytime.

## Documentation

An official documentation is being made, but you can still look at the PHPDoc in the classes
